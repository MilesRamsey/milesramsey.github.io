                I'm a young professional living in downtown Salt Lake City.  Currently I work as a Java Developer
                at Salesforce Commerce Cloud writing code for NAPA Auto Parts.  In my free time I enjoy playing dodgeball,
                playing retro video games, and most recently collecting records.  I always like to have a book to read, 
                and right now that book is Open by Rod Canion.  I'm always looking for something new to learn, and am 
                currently pursuing getting a Master's Degree.
