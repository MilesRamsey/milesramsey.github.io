I'm a young professional living in [downtown Salt Lake City](https://twitter.com/downtownslc). Currently I work as a Java Developer at [Salesforce Commerce Cloud](https://twitter.com/commercecloud) working on point of sale software. In my free time I enjoy playing [dodgeball and kickball](https://twitter.com/mileslimes/status/897924517837680640), playing retro video games, and most recently [collecting vinyl](https://twitter.com/mileslimes/status/889994504161312770). I always like to have a book to read, and currently it's [Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll](http://a.co/fRYfcJR). I'm always looking for something new to learn, and am currently pursuing getting a Master's Degree.
