I'm a young professional living in downtown Salt Lake City. Currently I work as a Java Developer at Salesforce Commerce Cloud writing code for NAPA Auto Parts. In my free time I enjoy playing dodgeball, playing retro video games, and most recently collecting records. I always like to have a book to read, and right now that book is Open by Rod Canion. I'm always looking for something new to learn, and am currently pursuing getting a Master's Degree.
